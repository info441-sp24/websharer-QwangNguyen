I chose to include the site_name.
The following link to my imdb page has the site name:
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm11995046/

For the changes to the html I centered the box, changed the colors and layout of the text within the box, and added hover affects for
when the user mouses over the box. I think this is an improvement because the box is now the focal point of the page. Additionally,
the box's new colors and layout I think are more appealing. Also having the hover effect allows the user to know when they can click
the box.

I worked on this code completely alone and received no help.
